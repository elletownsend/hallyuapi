# Hallyu API
The go-to API for data on all things Korean Wave: K-Pop Groups and Idols (1992-2020), and many popular Korean Actors. This repo contains all source code for the Hallyu API and API documentation.

The Hallyu API has been developed around REST principles. Our API has specified endpoint URLs for each resource, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.
